    - Your internal notes about the testimonial

13. **Rating** (Single select)

## How It Works:

### Testimonial Submission Flow:
1. **User submits testimonial** → Gets saved to Airtable with:
   - Status: "Pending Review"
   - Arrangement: 0 (hidden)
   - All user-provided data

### Admin Approval Process:
2. **Review testimonial in Airtable**:
   - Change Status to "Approved" or "Rejected"
   - For approved testimonials: Set Arrangement to positive number (1, 2, 3...)
   - Lower numbers display first (Arrangement 1 shows before Arrangement 2)

### Website Display:
3. **Testimonials appear on site when**:
   - Status = "Approved" AND Arrangement > 0
   - Displayed in Arrangement order (1, 2, 3...)
   - Featured testimonials always show (hardcoded)
   - All approved testimonials accessible via "View More" modal with pagination

### User Updates:
4. **Users can update their testimonials**:
   - Must provide the same email used for original submission
   - Updates existing record instead of creating duplicate
   - No email = can only create new testimonials, never update

## Environment Variables:

Make sure you have these set up (should already exist from your calendar booking):
- `AIRTABLE_API_KEY`
- `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID`

## Testing:

### Basic Functionality:
1. **Submit a test testimonial** through the website form
2. **Check Airtable** for the new "Testimonial Submissions" table
3. **Verify fields** are populated correctly:
   - Status: "Pending Review"
   - Arrangement: 0
   - All submitted data present

### Approval & Display:
4. **Approve testimonial**:
   - Change Status to "Approved"
   - Set Arrangement to 1 (or higher number)
5. **Check website** - testimonial should appear in "View More" modal
6. **Test ordering** by setting different Arrangement numbers

### Update Functionality:
7. **Test testimonial updates**:
   - Resubmit with same email → should update existing
   - Resubmit without email → should create new record
   - Try updating with different email → should create new record

## Humor & Randomization Features:

### **Random Funny Titles (30+ Options)**

- "Expert Overthinking Specialist"
- "Certified Coffee Addict"

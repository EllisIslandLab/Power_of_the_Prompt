# 🚀 Portal Authentication Fix - Setup Guide

Your authentication system has been completely rebuilt with a clean Supabase foundation. Here's what was fixed and how to complete the setup.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **Removed broken fallback authentication** - No more hardcoded profiles
2. **Created proper database schema** - Students and admin tables with RLS
3. **Fixed authentication hooks** - Clean user type detection
4. **Updated portal pages** - Proper role-based rendering
5. **Simplified login flow** - Direct authentication without workarounds

## 🗄️ Database Setup (REQUIRED)

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
3. **Run the schema**: Copy and paste the entire contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
4. **Update your admin email**: In the SQL, change `admin@weblaunchcoach.com` to your actual email address (line 178)

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### Step 1: Test Admin Access
1. Go to `/auth/signin`
2. Sign in with the email you set as admin in the SQL
3. You should see "Admin Access" badge and cohort management options

### Step 2: Test Student Registration
1. Go to `/auth/signup` 
2. Register with a new email
3. Check email for confirmation link
4. After confirming, sign in and you should see "Student Access"

### Step 3: Verify Data
In Supabase dashboard:
- Check `admin_users` table - should have your admin user
- Check `students` table - should auto-create for new users
- Check `auth.users` - should show both users

## 🎯 What's Now Working

### Authentication Flow
- ✅ Clean signup/signin process
- ✅ Automatic profile creation (students auto-created, admin pre-inserted)
- ✅ Proper user type detection (admin vs student)
- ✅ Protected routes with role-based access

### Portal Features
- ✅ Role-based dashboard (different for admin vs student)
- ✅ Student progress tracking
- ✅ Admin cohort management tools
- ✅ Jitsi session management (ready for future use)

### Security
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Students can only see their own data
- ✅ Admins can see all data
- ✅ Secure database triggers

## 🔧 If You Need to Reset Everything

If you want to completely start over:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to completely reset
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS students CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS admin_users CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS jitsi_sessions CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS student_enrollments CASCADE;

-- Then re-run the full supabase-schema.sql
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Run the SQL schema** (most important!)
2. **Test the login flow**
3. **Add real students** through signup
4. **Customize the portal** as needed

## 📁 Files Modified

- ✅ `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Complete rewrite for new schema
- ✅ `src/app/portal/page.tsx` - Updated for new user types
- ✅ `src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx` - Simplified login flow
- ✅ `supabase-schema.sql` - Complete database schema

## 🎉 The Result

You now have a **professional, scalable authentication system** that:
- Automatically handles user registration
- Properly separates admin and student access
- Scales for your growing coaching business
- Provides real-time data with Supabase
- Is ready for Jitsi video sessions

**No more authentication headaches!** 🙌

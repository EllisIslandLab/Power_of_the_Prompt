# Architecture Mastery Toolkit - Documentation

This folder contains all documentation and implementation guides for the Architecture Mastery Toolkit product.

## Contents

### Getting Started

1. **[Claude CLI Commands Guide](./CLAUDE_CLI_COMMANDS_GUIDE.md)** ⭐ **START HERE**
   - Complete guide to using Claude CLI with your toolkit
   - Command reference and best practices
   - Troubleshooting and tips
   - **Read this first before implementing any patterns**

2. **[Implementation Roadmap](./IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md)**
   - Strategic guide for implementing patterns in optimal order
   - Weekly schedules and time estimates
   - Success metrics and completion checklists
   - Common implementation paths for different app types

### Pattern Implementation Guides

3. **[Repository Pattern Guide](./REPOSITORY_PATTERN_GUIDE.md)**
   - When to use the Repository Pattern
   - Step-by-step implementation
   - Code examples and testing strategies
   - Common pitfalls and advanced features
   - Time saved: 8-12 hours → 2-3 hours

4. **[Dependency Injection Guide](./DEPENDENCY_INJECTION_GUIDE.md)**
   - Complete guide to Dependency Injection in TypeScript
   - Making code testable and flexible
   - Service lifecycle management
   - Testing with mock dependencies
   - Time saved: 10-14 hours → 3-4 hours

## Quick Start

1. **Read the Claude CLI Commands Guide** to learn how to use the toolkit commands
2. **Review the Implementation Roadmap** to plan your implementation strategy
3. **Pick your first pattern** (we recommend Repository Pattern)
4. **Read that pattern's implementation guide**
5. **Run the Claude CLI command** to generate the code
6. **Follow the implementation steps** in the guide
7. **Test and integrate** into your application

## Recommended Implementation Order

For most applications, we recommend this order:

1. **Repository Pattern** - Centralizes data access
2. **Dependency Injection** - Makes code testable and flexible
3. **Debugging Prompts** - Helps while implementing other patterns
4. **React Query** - Improves frontend data management (if applicable)
5. **Additional patterns** - As needed for your use case

See the [Implementation Roadmap](./IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) for detailed schedules and strategies.

## Time Savings

| Pattern | Manual Time | Toolkit Time | Time Saved |
|---------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Repository Pattern | 8-12 hours | 2-3 hours | 6-9 hours |
| Dependency Injection | 10-14 hours | 3-4 hours | 7-10 hours |
| React Query Setup | 8-12 hours | 2-3 hours | 6-9 hours |
| **Total** | **26-38 hours** | **7-10 hours** | **19-28 hours** |

## Document Structure

Each implementation guide follows this structure:

1. **Overview** - What the pattern is and why it matters
2. **When to Use** - Scenarios where this pattern shines
3. **Benefits** - Concrete advantages you'll gain
4. **Prerequisites** - What you need before starting
5. **Implementation Steps** - Detailed walkthrough
6. **Code Examples** - Real-world usage examples
7. **Testing** - How to test your implementation
8. **Common Pitfalls** - Mistakes to avoid
9. **Advanced Features** - Optional enhancements

## Support

If you need help:

1. Check the relevant implementation guide
2. Review the troubleshooting sections
3. Use the debugging prompts from your toolkit

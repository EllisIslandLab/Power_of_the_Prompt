## 4.4 Code Review and Optimization

### Understanding Generated Code

**Key Areas to Review:**

**1. Component Structure and Logic**
```tsx
// Review this pattern in generated components
interface ComponentProps {
  // Are prop types clearly defined?
  data: ProductData[]
  onAction: (id: string) => void
}

export default function Component({ data, onAction }: ComponentProps) {
  // Is the component logic clear and efficient?
  // Are there any potential performance issues?
  // Is error handling implemented?
}
```

**2. State Management**
```tsx
// Check for proper state management
const [items, setItems] = useState<Item[]>([])
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null)

// Are all necessary states included?
// Is state updated correctly?
// Are side effects handled properly?
```

**3. API Integration**
```tsx
// Verify API calls are secure and efficient
const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    setLoading(true)
    const response = await fetch('/api/products')
    const data = await response.json()
    setItems(data)
  } catch (err) {
    setError('Failed to load products')
  } finally {
    setLoading(false)
  }
}

// Is error handling comprehensive?
// Are loading states managed?
// Is the API call optimized?
```

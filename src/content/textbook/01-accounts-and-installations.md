# üìö Chapter 1: Accounts and Installations

---

## üîê 1.1 Account Setup Strategy and Security

### üîë Password Security Foundation

Before creating any accounts, establish a strong security foundation:

**Password Requirements:**
- Minimum 12 characters (16+ recommended)
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Unique password for each account
- No personal information (names, birthdays, addresses)

**Recommended Password Strategy:**
1. Use a Password Manager: Bitwarden (free), 1Password, or LastPass
2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on all accounts
3. Use unique passwords - never reuse passwords
4. Create a secure master password for your password manager

**Example Strong Password Structure:**
```
MyBusiness2025!WebDev#Secure
```

### ‚úÖ Account Security Checklist

Before proceeding with account creation, ensure you have:
- [ ] Password manager installed and configured
- [ ] Primary email account secured with 2FA
- [ ] Recovery email address set up
- [ ] Phone number verified for account recovery

## üíª 1.2 System Requirements and Software Installation

### üìã System Requirements Check

Before installation, verify your system meets requirements:

**Windows 10/11:**
- Version 1903 or higher
- 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)
- 20GB free disk space
- Administrative access

**Mac:**
- macOS 10.15 or later
- 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)
- 15GB free disk space
- Xcode Command Line Tools

**Linux:**
- Ubuntu 18.04+ (or equivalent)
- 8GB RAM minimum
- 15GB free disk space

### üìã Installation Order (Important!)

Install software in this specific order for optimal setup:

### üé® 1. Visual Studio Code Installation and Configuration

**Why VS Code First:**
- Required for all development work
- Needed to properly configure other tools
- Essential extensions must be installed early

**Download and Install:**

**Method 1: Website Download (Easier for beginners)**
1. Visit https://code.visualstudio.com
2. Download for your operating system
3. **Windows:** Run installer as Administrator (right-click ‚Üí "Run as Administrator")
4. Use recommended settings during installation
5. Launch VS Code when installation completes

**Method 2: Command Line Installation (Gets you used to CLI)**
**Windows (PowerShell as Admin):**
```powershell
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudioCode
```

**Mac:**
```bash
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

**Linux (Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo snap install --classic code
```

üí° **Both methods work perfectly - choose what feels more comfortable!**

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT FOR WINDOWS USERS:** Before installing extensions, you MUST install WSL first (see next section). The Claude Code extension requires a Linux environment to function properly.

### üêß 2. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - **INSTALL THIS FIRST!**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: You MUST run PowerShell as Administrator for ALL WSL commands!**

**Why WSL Must Be Installed BEFORE VS Code Extensions:**
- Claude CLI requires Linux environment to function
- VS Code WSL extension won't work without WSL installed first
- Claude Code extension needs WSL to operate properly on Windows

**Step-by-Step WSL Installation:**

**Step 1: Open PowerShell as Administrator**
- Press Windows key
- Type "PowerShell"
- Right-click "Windows PowerShell"
- Select "Run as Administrator"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **If you don't see "Run as Administrator", your account lacks admin rights - contact your system administrator**

**Step 2: Enable WSL Features**
```powershell
# Enable Windows Subsystem for Linux
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart

# Enable Virtual Machine Platform (required for WSL 2)
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
```

**Step 3: Restart Computer**
- **This restart is mandatory** - WSL won't work without it
- Save all work and restart now

**Step 4: Set WSL 2 as Default (After restart)**
- Open PowerShell as Administrator again
```powershell
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

**Step 5: Install Ubuntu Linux**
1. Open Microsoft Store (from Start Menu)
2. Search "Ubuntu 22.04 LTS"
3. Click "Install" (this may take 10-15 minutes)
4. Wait for "Launch" button to appear

**Step 6: Initial Ubuntu Setup**
1. Click "Launch" or find Ubuntu in Start Menu
2. Wait for "Installing, this may take a few minutes..."
3. Create username (lowercase only, no spaces):
   - Good: "johnsmith" or "webdev"  
   - Bad: "John Smith" or "user123!"
4. Create strong password (you'll need this often)
5. Confirm password

**Step 7: Update Ubuntu System**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

**Common WSL Issues and Solutions:**

*"WSL 2 requires an update to its kernel component"*
1. Go to: https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel
2. Download and install WSL2 Linux kernel update package
3. Restart computer

*"The requested operation could not be completed due to a virtual disk system limitation"*
1. Open "Turn Windows features on or off"
2. Enable "Hyper-V" 
3. Restart computer

*"Access denied" or "Permission denied"*
- You didn't run PowerShell as Administrator
- Start over with Administrator privileges

### üé® 3. VS Code Extensions Installation (After WSL is Ready)

**Now that WSL is installed, you can safely install these extensions:**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Install Only These 4 Extensions** - Since Claude CLI handles most coding, we only need the essentials:

**ü§ñ 1. Claude Code Extension (REQUIRED):**
   - Open VS Code Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search "Claude Code" 
   - Install the official Anthropic extension
   - This integrates AI assistance directly into your editor

**üêß 2. WSL Extension (Windows users only):**
   - Search "WSL"
   - Install "WSL" by Microsoft
   - Allows VS Code to work inside Linux environment

**‚úÖ 3. ESLint (RECOMMENDED):**
   - Search "ESLint"
   - Install "ESLint" by Microsoft
   - Catches potential bugs and code issues automatically

**üé® 4. Prettier (RECOMMENDED):**
   - Search "Prettier"
   - Install "Prettier - Code formatter"
   - Keeps code clean and readable (helps Claude CLI work better)

**üí° Why So Few Extensions?**
Since Claude CLI writes most of your code, you don't need developer productivity tools like:
- ‚ùå JavaScript snippets (Claude writes the code for you)
- ‚ùå Auto-rename tags (rarely needed with AI assistance)
- ‚ùå Git visualization tools (basic git commands are sufficient)

**Start simple - add more extensions only if you find yourself needing specific functionality!**

### ‚ö° 4. Node.js Installation

**Installation Steps:**

**Windows (with WSL):**
```bash
# In Ubuntu terminal
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

**Mac:**
```bash
# Install Homebrew first if not installed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install Node.js
brew install node
```

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```
Should show v18+ and v9+ respectively.

### üîß 5. Git Installation and Configuration

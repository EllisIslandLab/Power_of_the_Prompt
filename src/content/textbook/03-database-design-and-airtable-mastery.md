### Database Design Principles

**Fundamental Database Concepts:**

**Tables (Bases in Airtable):** Think of tables like spreadsheets, where each table stores one type of information.

**Records (Rows):** Each record represents one item (one product, one customer, one order).

**Fields (Columns):** Each field represents one piece of information about the item.

**Example E-commerce Database Structure:**

**Products Table:**
| Product ID | Name           | Price | Description      | Category  | Image URL |
|------------|----------------|-------|------------------|-----------|-----------|
| P001       | Handmade Mug   | 25.00 | Ceramic coffee   | Kitchen   | mug.jpg   |
| P002       | Wooden Spoon   | 15.00 | Carved utensil   | Kitchen   | spoon.jpg |
| P003       | Throw Pillow   | 35.00 | Decorative       | Home      | pillow.jpg|

**Customers Table:**
| Customer ID | Name        | Email              | Phone        | Date Added |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------|--------------|------------|
| C001        | John Smith  | john@email.com     | 555-0123     | 2025-01-15 |
| C002        | Jane Doe    | jane@email.com     | 555-0456     | 2025-01-16 |

**Orders Table:**
| Order ID | Customer ID | Product IDs | Total | Status    | Date       |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------|-----------|------------|
| O001     | C001        | P001, P002  | 40.00 | Completed | 2025-01-20 |
| O002     | C002        | P003        | 35.00 | Pending   | 2025-01-21 |

## 3.3 API Integration and Security

### Understanding Airtable API

**What is an API?**
API (Application Programming Interface) allows your website to communicate with your Airtable database:
- **GET:** Retrieve data (show products on website)
- **POST:** Add new data (new contact form submissions)
- **PUT:** Update existing data (change product availability)
- **DELETE:** Remove data (discontinue products)

**Airtable API Benefits:**
- Automatic API generation for every base
- RESTful API that works with any programming language
- Real-time data synchronization
- Built-in authentication and security

### Generating and Managing API Keys

**Creating Your Airtable API Key:**
1. Go to https://airtable.com/create/tokens
2. Click "Create new token"
3. Token name: "[Business Name] Website Integration"
4. Scopes: Select appropriate permissions:
   - `data.records:read` - Read data from tables
   - `data.records:write` - Add new records (contact forms)
   - `schema.bases:read` - Read database structure
5. Access: Select your specific base
6. Click "Create token"
7. **IMMEDIATELY COPY** the token (you won't see it again)

**API Key Security Rules:**
- **NEVER** commit API keys to Git repositories
- **NEVER** share API keys in email or chat
- Store in password manager immediately
- Use environment variables in all code
- Rotate keys monthly for security

### Airtable Base and Table IDs

**Finding Your Base ID:**
1. Go to https://airtable.com/api
2. Select your base
3. Base ID is shown in the URL and documentation
4. Format: `appXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`

**Finding Table IDs:**
Table IDs are the table names, but use exact capitalization and spacing:
- "Products/Services" table → `Products/Services`
- "Customer Inquiries" table → `Customer Inquiries`
- "Orders/Bookings" table → `Orders/Bookings`

**Example API Configuration:**
```typescript
// lib/airtable.ts
const AIRTABLE_API_KEY = process.env.AIRTABLE_API_KEY
const AIRTABLE_BASE_ID = process.env.AIRTABLE_BASE_ID

const airtableConfig = {
  apiKey: AIRTABLE_API_KEY,
  baseId: AIRTABLE_BASE_ID,
  tables: {
    products: 'Products/Services',
    inquiries: 'Customer Inquiries',
    orders: 'Orders/Bookings'
  }
}
```

### Documentation Best Practices with docs/ Folder

**Why Use Structured Documentation for Airtable Integration?**
When integrating Airtable with your website, maintaining accurate documentation of form fields and their corresponding Airtable fields is crucial for:
- Team collaboration and onboarding
- Debugging integration issues
- Future development and maintenance
- Ensuring data consistency across your application
- Tracking changes over time

**Creating a Comprehensive CHANGELOG.md:**

**1. Create docs/ Folder Structure:**
Organize your documentation in a structured way:

```
docs/
├── README.md              # Documentation overview
├── api/                   # API documentation
├── architecture/          # System design docs
├── deployment/           # Setup and deployment guides
├── guides/               # Step-by-step tutorials
└── changelog/            # Database and API changes
    └── CHANGELOG.md      # Airtable integration changes
```

**2. Create CHANGELOG.md for Airtable:**
This file should contain all Airtable table structures and field mappings:

```markdown
# Airtable Integration Changelog

## Current Airtable Tables and Field Mappings

### [Table Name] Table
**Files:** `path/to/api/file.ts`
**Last Updated:** [Date]

**Required Form Fields → Airtable Fields:**
- `formFieldName` → `Airtable Field Name` (field type)
- `email` → `Email` (email)
- `phone` → `Phone Number` (phone number)

**Optional Form Fields → Airtable Fields:**
- `businessType` → `Business Type` (single select)
- `description` → `Description` (long text)

**System-Generated Fields:**
- `Status` (single select) - automatically set based on form type
- `Created Date` (date) - timestamp of submission

**Form Value Mappings:**
- Business Type: `service`→"Service-based", `product`→"Product-based"

**Special Handling:**
- Records without required fields are filtered out
- Arrays stored as comma-separated strings
```

**3. Update Your README.md:**
Reference the comprehensive documentation from your README:

```markdown
## Documentation

📖 **[Complete Documentation](./docs/README.md)** - Comprehensive guides

### Quick Links
- **[API Documentation](./docs/api/README.md)** - Complete API reference
- **[Airtable Integration](./docs/changelog/CHANGELOG.md)** - Database field mappings

**4. Maintain Change History:**
Always document changes with dates and descriptions:

```markdown
## Change History

### 2025-07-31 - Added Customer Portal Fields
- **Added:** `subscriptionStatus` field to Customer table
- **Modified:** `timeline` field options updated
- **Removed:** Deprecated `oldField` from Contact form

### 2025-07-15 - Initial Documentation
- **Added:** Complete documentation of all current tables
```

**5. Establish Maintenance Process:**
Create a workflow for keeping documentation current:

**When Adding New Fields:**
1. Update the API route code
2. Immediately update CHANGELOG.md with new field mappings
3. Add entry to Change History section
4. Test the integration thoroughly
5. Verify Airtable field configuration matches documentation

**When Modifying Existing Fields:**
1. Update API route code
2. Update CHANGELOG.md field mappings
3. Document the change in Change History with reason
4. Update any related form validation
5. Test thoroughly with existing data

**6. Include Maintenance Guidelines:**
Add a section to help future developers:

```markdown
## Maintenance Guidelines

When making changes to Airtable field mappings:

1. **Update the code** in the appropriate API route file
2. **Update this CHANGELOG.md** with the new field mappings
3. **Add an entry** to the Change History section
4. **Test thoroughly** to ensure integration works
5. **Verify Airtable** field configuration matches documentation

**Important:** Always maintain backwards compatibility when possible.
```

**7. Benefits of This Approach:**
- **Centralized Documentation:** All Airtable information in one place
- **Change Tracking:** Historical record of all modifications
- **Team Onboarding:** New developers can quickly understand data flow
- **Debug Support:** Easy to identify when and why changes were made
- **Clean README:** Keeps main documentation focused and uncluttered

**Template for New Tables:**
```markdown
### [Table Name] Table
**Files:** `src/app/api/[endpoint]/route.ts`
**Last Updated:** [Date]
**Purpose:** [Brief description of what this table stores]

**Required Fields:**
- `fieldName` → `Airtable Field` (type) - [description]

**Optional Fields:**
- `fieldName` → `Airtable Field` (type) - [description]

**Form Value Mappings:**
- [Field]: `form_value`→"Display Value"

**Special Handling:**
- [Any unique processing or validation rules]
```

This approach ensures your Airtable integration documentation stays organized, current, and useful for your entire team throughout the project lifecycle.

## 3.4 Environment Variables and Token Management

### Understanding Environment Variables

**What are Environment Variables?**
Environment variables store sensitive information outside your code:
- API keys and tokens
- Database connection strings
- Third-party service credentials
- Configuration settings

**Why Use Environment Variables?**
- **Security:** Keep secrets out of source code
- **Flexibility:** Different settings for development/production
- **Collaboration:** Team members use their own credentials
- **Deployment:** Easy configuration across environments

### Consistent Naming Convention

**Standardized Variable Names:**
Use these exact names across all environments:

**Airtable Variables:**
```bash
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=appXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

**Anthropic Variables:**
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-XXXXXXXX
```

**Stripe Variables:**
```bash
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_XXXXXXXX
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_XXXXXXXX
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_XXXXXXXX
```

**Next.js Variables:**
```bash
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### Local Development Environment Variables

**Creating .env.local File:**
In your Next.js project root, create `.env.local`:

```bash
# Airtable Configuration
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=patXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=appXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Anthropic Configuration  
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Stripe Configuration (Test Keys)
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_51XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_51XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Development Settings
NODE_ENV=development
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Security for .env.local:**
- Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore` file
- Never commit environment files to Git
- Create separate files for different team members
- Document required variables in README

### Production Environment Variables (Netlify)

**Setting Up Netlify Environment Variables:**
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Select your site
3. Go to Site settings → Environment variables
4. Add each variable:

**Variable Configuration:**
```
Key: AIRTABLE_API_KEY
Value: patXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Scope: All scopes

Key: AIRTABLE_BASE_ID  
Value: appXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Scope: All scopes

Key: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
Value: sk-ant-api03-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Scope: All scopes
```

**Production vs Development:**
- Use test/sandbox keys for development
- Use live/production keys for production
- Never mix development and production credentials
- Monitor usage and billing for production keys

### Environment Variable Security Checklist

**Before Deployment:**
- [ ] All sensitive data moved to environment variables
- [ ] `.env.local` added to `.gitignore`
- [ ] Production variables configured in Netlify
- [ ] Test and production keys clearly separated
- [ ] Team members have their own development keys

**Regular Security Maintenance:**
- [ ] Monthly API key rotation
- [ ] Review and remove unused variables
- [ ] Monitor API usage for anomalies
- [ ] Update team access as needed
- [ ] Document any changes to variable names

### Backup and Recovery Strategy

**Environment Variable Backup:**
Create a secure backup document with variable names (NOT values):

```markdown
# Environment Variables Backup Template

## Required Variables for [Business Name] Website

### Airtable Integration
- AIRTABLE_API_KEY: [Location in password manager]
- AIRTABLE_BASE_ID: [Documented in project notes]

### Anthropic Integration  
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: [Location in password manager]

### Stripe Integration
- STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: [Stripe dashboard - test/live]
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: [Location in password manager] 
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET: [Stripe webhook settings]

### Deployment Settings
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL: [Your domain]
- NODE_ENV: production
```

**Recovery Procedures:**
1. **Lost API Key:** Regenerate in respective service
2. **Compromised Key:** Immediately regenerate and update all environments
3. **Team Member Departure:** Rotate all shared credentials
4. **Environment Corruption:** Restore from backup documentation

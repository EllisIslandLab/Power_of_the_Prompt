## üé® 4.17 Visual Design Principles for UI Elements

### Consistency is Key

All interface elements on your website should follow consistent patterns:
- **Same button styles** across the site
- **Consistent spacing** and padding
- **Unified color scheme** for states (success, error, warning, info)
- **Matching typography** hierarchy
- **Similar interaction patterns** (hover effects, transitions)

**[IMAGE: Design system consistency]**

**AI Image Prompt:**
*"Design system consistency guide showing: color palette (primary, secondary, success, warning, error, neutral), typography scale (H1, H2, H3, body, small), spacing scale (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px), button styles (primary, secondary, tertiary), form elements all using consistent styling. Professional design system documentation"*

---

### Accessibility Considerations

Every interface element should be:
- **Keyboard accessible** - Can be used without a mouse
- **Screen reader friendly** - Proper ARIA labels
- **High contrast** - Readable for visually impaired
- **Touch-friendly** - Large enough tap targets on mobile (44x44px minimum)
- **Clear feedback** - Visual indication of interactive elements

### Mobile-First Responsive Design

**[IMAGE: Responsive interface elements]**

**AI Image Prompt:**
*"Three-screen responsive design showing same interface element: mobile (stacked vertical layout, large touch targets), tablet (hybrid layout), desktop (horizontal layout with more space). Demonstrate how navigation, forms, and cards adapt. Clear breakpoint labels (320px, 768px, 1024px)"*

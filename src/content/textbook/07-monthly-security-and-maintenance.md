### Security Key Rotation Schedule

**Monthly API Key Rotation:**
Security best practice requires rotating all sensitive credentials monthly to prevent unauthorized access and limit exposure if credentials are compromised.

**API Keys to Rotate Monthly:**

**Airtable API Keys:**
1. Go to https://airtable.com/create/tokens
2. Create new token with same permissions as existing
3. Update environment variables in Vercel
4. Update local development environment
5. Test all integrations
6. Delete old token after confirmation

**Anthropic API Keys:**
1. Visit https://console.anthropic.com
2. Go to API Keys section
3. Generate new key
4. Update ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in all environments
5. Test Claude CLI functionality
6. Revoke old key

**Stripe API Keys:**
1. Log into Stripe Dashboard
2. Go to Developers → API keys
3. Roll keys for both test and live environments
4. Update STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
5. Test payment processing
6. Monitor for any failed transactions

## 7.3 User Experience Updates Without Sacrificing Familiarity

### Strategic Website Updates

**The Balance Principle:**
When updating your website, maintain the 80/20 rule: keep 80% of the user interface familiar while updating 20% with improvements. This ensures users don't get confused while still modernizing your site.

**Safe Update Categories:**

**Visual Refreshes (Low Risk):**
- Color adjustments within the same palette
- Typography improvements (better readability)
- Spacing and padding refinements
- Icon updates with similar meanings
- Image quality improvements

**Content Updates (Medium Risk):**
- Adding new sections without removing existing ones
- Expanding existing content with more details
- Adding new product/service categories
- Improving copy while maintaining key messages

**Functionality Enhancements (High Risk - Requires Careful Planning):**
- New navigation elements
- Additional form fields
- New interactive features
- Checkout process modifications

### User-Intuitive Design Updates

**Monthly Design Review Process:**

**Step 1: User Feedback Collection**
- Review customer support inquiries for UI confusion
- Analyze Google Analytics for high bounce rate pages
- Check form abandonment rates
- Monitor time-on-page for key content

**Step 2: A/B Testing for Changes**
Before implementing major changes:
```javascript
// Example: Testing new button color
// Use Vercel's built-in analytics or Google Optimize
const buttonVariant = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'primary' : 'secondary'

<Button className={`btn-${buttonVariant}`}>
  Call to Action
</Button>
```

**Step 3: Gradual Implementation**
- Implement changes in preview environments first
- Test with a small group of users
- Monitor analytics for negative impacts
- Roll back quickly if users show confusion

2. Identify areas needing refactoring
3. Update deprecated dependencies
4. Improve error handling and user feedback

### Safe Implementation Practices

**Feature Flag Implementation:**
```typescript
// lib/featureFlags.ts
export const featureFlags = {
  newCheckoutFlow: process.env.ENABLE_NEW_CHECKOUT === 'true',
  enhancedSearch: process.env.ENABLE_ENHANCED_SEARCH === 'true',
  darkMode: process.env.ENABLE_DARK_MODE === 'true'
}

// In component
import { featureFlags } from '@/lib/featureFlags'

export default function SearchComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      {featureFlags.enhancedSearch ? (
        <EnhancedSearchComponent />
      ) : (
        <StandardSearchComponent />
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Progressive Enhancement Approach:**
1. **Start with Core Functionality:** Ensure basic features work without JavaScript
2. **Add Enhanced Features:** Layer on improved experiences for capable browsers
3. **Test Fallbacks:** Ensure graceful degradation for older browsers
4. **Monitor Performance:** Track impact on page load and user metrics

### User Testing and Feedback

        <Analytics />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

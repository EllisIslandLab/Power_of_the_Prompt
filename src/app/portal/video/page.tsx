COMMENTED OUT - Complex video conferencing page
This page contains complex authentication logic and video conferencing dependencies that may interfere with the new authentication system.
Commented out during auth transition - can be re-enabled later when video functionality is needed.

Original functionality: Standalone video conferencing page with Jitsi Meet integration,
participant management, admin quick rooms, and real-time video communication.

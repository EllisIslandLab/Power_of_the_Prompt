COMMENTED OUT - Complex collaboration page with video conferencing
This page contains complex authentication logic and video conferencing dependencies that may interfere with the new authentication system.
Commented out during auth transition - can be re-enabled later when collaboration functionality is needed.

Original functionality: Full-featured collaboration hub with Jitsi video conferencing,
session management, real-time participant tracking, and admin privileges.

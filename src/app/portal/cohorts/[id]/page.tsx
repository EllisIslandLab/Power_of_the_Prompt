COMMENTED OUT - Complex cohort details page with database queries
This page contains complex authentication logic and database dependencies that may interfere with the new authentication system.
Commented out during auth transition - can be re-enabled later when cohort functionality is needed.

Original functionality: Detailed cohort management page with student enrollment tracking,
progress monitoring, curriculum management, and complex role-based permissions.

COMMENTED OUT - Complex cohort listing page
This page contains complex authentication logic and database dependencies that may interfere with the new authentication system.
Commented out during auth transition - can be re-enabled later when cohort functionality is needed.

Original functionality: Cohort listing and management page with role-based filtering,
database queries for cohort data, and complex admin/coach permissions.
